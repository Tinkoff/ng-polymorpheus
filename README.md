## What does it do?

It abstracts over different ways of view customization in Angular with one simple component:

```html
<polymorpheus-outlet [content]="content" [context]="context"></polymorpheus-outlet>
```

**Content** accepts:

-   primitives like `number` or `string`
-   functions that take `context` as argument and return a primitive
-   templates that get instantiated with given `context`
-   components that would get `context` injected through DI

**Context** is optional when you need your **content** to adapt to the situation

## How to use it?

Typical use case would be a component that accepts visual customization and defines
context by itself. Say a menu list where you can configure how each item should look
like by passing a template. And context would be item itself and, for example,
whether it is focused or not.

Please see [extensive demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/TinkoffCreditSystems/ng-polymorpheus/tree/master/projects/demo).
